# CSS 225 – Module 4 Lab Activity: Debugging

## Description

This repository contains corrected versions of Python programs assigned in **Module 4 – Debugging Lab Activity** for CSS 225. The goal of this lab was to identify and fix bugs related to common Python errors such as syntax issues, name errors, indentation problems, and logical mistakes. The debugging skills demonstrated here are essential to build a strong foundation in programming.

## Files Included

- `time.py` – Corrected script related to time calculations
- `time2.py` – Extended time-based logic
- `pirate.py` – Debugged code with pirate-themed variable usage
- `collection.py` – Corrected issues in list and loop logic
- `branching.py` – Fixes conditional branching errors
- `grading.py` – Debugged grading logic based on score inputs

Each file contains comments with:
- Student name  
- Date  
- Problem number and description  
- Bug fixes and clarifications  

## Learning Objectives

- Identify and correct common Python errors:
  - SyntaxErrors (e.g., missing colons, wrong indentation)
  - NameErrors (undefined variables)
  - Logical errors in control flow
- Develop debugging strategies using:
  - `print()` statements
  - Error traceback analysis
  - Incremental code testing

## How to Run

To test the scripts:

```bash
python time.py
python pirate.py
# ... and so on
